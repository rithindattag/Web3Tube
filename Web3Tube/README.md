<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get this application up and and running on your local machine follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js, NPM and hardhat installed on your computer, before running this project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Create an `.env` file and get an API key from Livepeer studio, Web3 Storage and Imagekit. 
   ```sh
   PRIVATE_KEY=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEPEER_KEY=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_ID=""
   ```
4. Compile the smart contract
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
5. Deploy the smart contract
6. Get your contract address and paste in on `constants/index.ts`

7. Deploy subgraph in `indexer` directory by following steps in `indexer/README.md` (optional, since it is already deployed in hosted service)

8. Get subgraph query endpoint after deployment and update it in `constants/index.t`

9. Run the app

   ```sh
   npm start
